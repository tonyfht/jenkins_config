	The plugin will create a view in the workspace with the specified view path name. The view is a normal folder
	which can be accessed by the build tools. Make sure that there is no other folder in the workspace 
	with the same name as the specified view name. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If the view path is left empty, the view tag will be used as view path.
	</p>
  <p>
  	The view path relative to the workspace is available as an environment variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWNAME</code>.
  	<br/> 
  	The absolute path to the ClearCase view is available as an environment 
  	variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWPATH</code>.
