  <p>
    The plugin, when set to poll for changes (i.e. non-zero value of <i>Multi-site poll buffer</i>),
    will check for any changes on the branch or stream in question since
    the previous build started. When one or more of the branches/streams being polled against are mastered at another
    site and are synced to the site Jenkins is polling at via MultiSite, this may result in problems polling against
    changes made to remote branches/streams before the previous build started, but which weren't synced to the local
    site until after the previous build started.
  </p>
  <p>
    To compensate for this, you may specify a buffer, in minutes, to subtract from the previous build time to generate
    the time to poll against. While this is not optimal (if a change occured on a local branch/stream being polled against
    during the MultiSite poll buffer before the previous build, the next poll will detect that change and kick off a new
    build, etc), it should allow for guaranteeing that changes from remote sites aren't missed.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this value is set to 0 (the default), no buffer is used. 
    Also, instead of checking for changes since last build, only changes since <b>last poll</b> will be detected.
