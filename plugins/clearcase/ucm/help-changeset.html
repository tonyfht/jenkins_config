	<b>No History</b> means no changeset will be calculated for any build. This can be useful to make jobs that build on a readonly stream, on which you don't want the difference between two successive builds
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Current stream</b> means changeset will be only calculated from changes done on current stream. If the stream is rebased, you will only see files that have been merged. This is the default value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Current stream + rebases</b> means changeset will be calculated from changes done on current stream and from foundation baselines.<br/>
    You will see changes done due to a rebase even if they didn't create any new version on your current stream.
